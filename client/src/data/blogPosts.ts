### Key Takeaways

1. **4K is the new standard**: Plan for 25-35 Mbps per stream
2. **Upload matters more**: Video calls and gaming need symmetrical speeds
3. **Latency beats bandwidth**: For gaming and real-time applications
4. **Buffer for growth**: Bandwidth needs double every 3-5 years
5. **Quality over quantity**: Consistent speeds beat high maximums

### Quick Formula

**Simple Calculation:**
1. Count 4K devices × 35 Mbps
2. Add HD devices × 10 Mbps
3. Add gaming/work × 25 Mbps
4. Multiply by 1.5 for buffer
5. Round up to next plan tier

Remember: It's better to have excess bandwidth than to constantly manage limitations. Choose a plan that handles your peak usage comfortably, with room for growth.
