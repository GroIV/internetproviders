# Production Readiness Plan - Internet Provider Analytics

## Executive Summary

This document outlines all demo content, placeholders, and incomplete features that must be addressed before launching to production. The platform currently has significant placeholder content and missing core functionality that needs to be completed.

## üö® Critical Issues - Must Fix Before Launch

### 1. Security & Authentication
- **Session Secret**: Hardcoded in `/server/routes.ts` - must use environment variable
- **No Authentication**: User login/signup completely missing
- **No Admin Auth**: Admin pages accessible to anyone
- **Missing Security Headers**: No rate limiting, CORS not configured
- **Console Logging**: 11+ files logging sensitive data

### 2. Placeholder Content
- **Provider Logos**: All using `via.placeholder.com` URLs
- **Blog Images**: Referencing non-existent local files
- **Author Avatars**: Placeholder paths that don't exist
- **Footer Links**: All links go to "#" (non-functional)

### 3. Non-Functional Features
- **AI Assistant**: Returns hardcoded responses only
- **Admin Pages**: All show "coming soon" message
- **Social Media Links**: Not connected
- **Legal Pages**: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service missing
