# Internet Provider Analytics - AI/LLM Documentation

## Project Overview
Internet Provider Analytics is a comprehensive web platform that helps consumers make informed decisions about internet service providers (ISPs) through AI-powered analysis, real-time coverage data, and educational resources.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Provider Comparison Engine
- **Purpose**: Compare internet providers based on location, speed, price, and technology type
- **Key Features**:
  - ZIP code-based availability search
  - Side-by-side provider comparison
  - Speed tier analysis (25 Mbps to 10 Gbps)
  - Pricing transparency with promotional vs regular rates
  - Technology comparison (Fiber, Cable, DSL, 5G, Satellite)

### 2. Coverage Mapping System
- **Purpose**: Visualize ISP coverage areas and network infrastructure
- **Technologies**: Mapbox GL JS for interactive maps
- **Data Points**:
  - Provider service boundaries
  - Network technology types by area
  - Speed availability by location
  - Infrastructure proximity data

### 3. AI-Powered Recommendations
- **Purpose**: Provide personalized ISP recommendations using machine learning
- **Factors Analyzed**:
  - Household size and usage patterns
  - Work-from-home requirements
  - Entertainment preferences (streaming, gaming)
  - Budget constraints
  - Future scalability needs

### 4. Educational Resource Hub
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive guides on internet technologies and optimization
- **Content Categories**:
  - **Basics**: Understanding speeds, bandwidth, latency
  - **Tips**: Wi-Fi optimization, security best practices
  - **Comparisons**: Technology differences, provider evaluations

## Technical Architecture

- **Coverage Data**: ZIP code level granularity
- **User Data**: Encrypted authentication, preferences
- **Analytics**: Usage patterns, popular comparisons

## Key Algorithms and Logic

### 1. Provider Matching Algorithm
```
Factors weighted by importance:
- Speed requirements (30%)
- Budget constraints (25%)
- Technology preference (20%)
- Contract flexibility (15%)
- Customer satisfaction (10%)
```

### 2. Coverage Calculation
- Geocoding user addresses to coordinates
- Matching coordinates to provider service areas
- Calculating distance to nearest infrastructure
- Estimating actual vs advertised speeds

### 3. Speed Recommendation Logic
```
Single Person: 50-100 Mbps
Small Family (2-3): 100-300 Mbps
Large Family (4+): 300-500 Mbps
Power Users: 500 Mbps - 1 Gbps
Businesses: 1 Gbps+
```
